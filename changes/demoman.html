    Stickybomb Launcher

  <p>
   Compared to a lot of other people, I'm mostly fine with the power of Demoman. However, I would like to introduce more counterplay to traps. Currently,
   traps have few ways to effectively destroy them and aren't telegraphed as well as many of the game's other one-shots.
  </p>
  <p>
   I also think making stickies more
   obvious in general would make them more intuitive to play against. Rocket visuals make it clear where they are and where they're going, and they read
   as immediate threats. Stickies aren't as obvious and don't look immediately threatening even though they absolutely are.

  <p>
   This weapon is very underused because of how specialised, slow and defensive it is. Giving it sticky spam capabilities would run counter to the
   weapon's design, but I'd like to see if I can give the weapon some offensive capabilities while still feeling like itself.
