    <p>
	 The knockback on this weapon is, more often than not, a liability. The first shot blasts the target out of range of the second shot, forcing the user to have to fight the weapon in order to use it to its full potential.

	     This means that the knockback behaves more like explosive knockback and less like Airblast
