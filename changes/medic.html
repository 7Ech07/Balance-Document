    Syringe Gun
  </h2>
  <p>
   On top of being massively overshadowed by the Crossbow, the Syringe Gun archetype suffers from slow projectile speed and other jank that makes
   it unnessesarily clunky to use.
  </p>
  <p>
   I'd also like to take this opportunity to rework Medic, as he's a design I've never really liked. Few people particularly like playing him, and
   yet he's powerful to the degree that not having him on your team is throwing, which only exacerbates the previous issue. I think the first problem
   is because Medic is overly passive -- his healing requires minimal active input, he's actively discouraged from participating in combat, and he has
   little ability to make plays on his own. Shifiting some focus onto the primary weapon both as a weapon and a medical tool could help with this.
