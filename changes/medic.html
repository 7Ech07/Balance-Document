  <h2>
    Syringe Gun
  </h2>
  <p>
   On top of being massively overshadowed by the Crossbow, the Syringe Gun archetype suffers from slow projectile speed and other jank that makes
   it unnessesarily clunky to use.
  </p>
  <p>
   I'd also like to take this opportunity to rework Medic, as he's a design I've never really liked. Few people particularly like playing him, and
   yet he's powerful to the degree that not having him on your team is throwing, which only exacerbates the previous issue. I think the first problem
   is because Medic is overly passive -- his healing requires minimal active input, he's actively discouraged from participating in combat, and he has
   little ability to make plays on his own. Shifiting some focus onto the primary weapon both as a weapon and a medical tool could help with this.

  <h2>
    Crusader's Crossbow
  </h2>
  <p>
   The Syringe Gun changes demand that the Crossbow's identity be re-examined. Instead of damage for healing, I want the trade-off to be short-range
   self-defence for mid-range offensive burst. With neither weapon being obviously better at doing Medic things, I hope there isn't any obligation to
   pick one or the other.

  <h2>
    Medi-Gun
  </h2>
  <p>
   Given the changes to the Syringe Gun, I can't just leave the Medi-Gun as it is. I want to reduce its output to compensate for the primary healing, so
   the Medic isn't putting out too much healing overall. The ability to keep multiple people overhealed at a time also outdoes what most classes are able to
   bring to their team, and I think restricting overheal mainly to one person at a time would be
