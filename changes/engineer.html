          The design of this weapon – trade some of your power normally for a boost when you would otherwise 
		  be vulnerable – is interesting, but the current implementation creates some issues. In addition to
		  being another weapon that can snowball off kills, enemies are often unable to tell if destroying any
		  given Sentry will grant the Engie Crits, how many Crits the Engie gets, and whether or not he still
		  has them when the weapon is stowed. I also dislike how the loadout system allows players to take advantage
		  of the weapon's strength situationally without needing to engage with its downside.

         The last nerf to this item was intended to reduce its overall power due to the sheer amount of utility
		 it provides. The change succeeded at this, but the item is still extremely powerful in defensive 
		 scenarios because of how it significantly reduces risk to the Engineer. I think a more targeted change
		 to address this problem would make the weapon more fair.
