        <p>
          The design of this weapon – trade some of your power normally for a boost when you would otherwise 
		  be vulnerable – is interesting, but the current implementation creates some issues. In addition to
		  being another weapon that can snowball off kills, enemies are often unable to tell if destroying any
		  given Sentry will grant the Engie Crits, how many Crits the Engie gets, and whether or not he still
		  has them when the weapon is stowed. I also dislike how the loadout system allows players to take advantage
		  of the weapon's strength situationally without needing to engage with its downside.

         The last nerf to this item was intended to reduce its overall power due to the sheer amount of utility
		 it provides. The change succeeded at this, but the item is still extremely powerful in defensive 
		 scenarios because of how it significantly reduces risk to the Engineer. I think a more targeted change
		 to address this problem would make the weapon more fair.

        <h2>Wrangler</h2>
        <p>
         The current version of the Wrangler is extremely good at stalling pushes due to its ability to create a 
		 600 health object that can waste the vast majority of an Über’s duration on its own. This ability also 
		 requires fairly little effort from the Engineer player.
        </p>
        <p>
		Removing the shield entirely would fix this problem, but it would also make the item really weak, 
		as Sentries were tuned around the Engineer’s repair rate and can be quickly destroyed when not receiving
		in-combat repairs. Something must be given in compensation for the shield.
        </p>
        <p>
		Lifesteal on the Sentry still allows it to tank more damage, but it requires the Engineer to use the 
		item for its intended purpose, and still leaves the Sentry vulnerable to the things it’s designed to be 
		vulnerable to.

        <h2>Short Circuit</h2>
        <p>
         The previous rework of this item was intended to make it more skillful and more reliant on positioning and anticipation. 
		 It was a resounding failure. The energy ball takes significantly less timing and effort to use than the old electrical
		 field attack, while being able to cover a significant area for a whole two seconds at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
		The general concept of the Short Circuit is questionable, both in terms of how it tries to negate one of the pillars of the game’s combat,
		and in how it's largely restricted to fighting two classes. I’ve decided to de-emphasise projectile destruction and add other utilities.

        <h2>Gunslinger & Mini-Sentry</h2>

         The Gunslinger is a somewhat polarising weapon. It's especially threatening to short-range classes who
		 struggle to effectively kill the Mini-Sentries. However, the Minis are more of an annoyance than a threat
		 to classes like Demo, and in my opinion the Gunslinger doesn't keep up with the Jag even for aggressive play.
