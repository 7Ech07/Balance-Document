        <h2>Hitscan Weapons</h2>
        <p>
          Most hitscan weapons have a 1.25 second cooldown after firing before the weapon becomes perfectly accurate
          again (Shotguns and Miniguns have a 0.25 second cooldown instead). For some reason, the accuracy stays bad for
          the entire 1.25 seconds and suddenly becomes perfect again, instead of gradually becoming more accurate as you
          would intuitively expect.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is mostly just relevant to the Revolvers (except the Ambassador, which already has this). The other
          weapons are getting it for the sake of consistency.

        <h2>Projectile Weapons</h2>
        <p>
          This is maybe a bit petty, but it’s always annoyed me how projectile weapons have a left/right bias that you
          need to compensate for up close. Making projectiles always fire from the centre would be ugly and make it
          harder to shoot around corners, so I came up with this as a compromise that is hopefully minimally obtrusive.
          I chose 200 HU since it’s the minimum distance at which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUPBC5W1KHo&t=0s" target="_blank" title="Shounic's video on this topic">projectile aim correction</a> works.

        <h2>Shotgun</h2>
        <p>
          For some bizarre reason, there are four (technically five) variants of the stock Shotgun in the game’s code,
          and some of them have slightly different stats. Soldier and Pyro have a slightly slower reload on their stock
          Shotguns than Heavy and Engineer. None of their reload speeds also align correctly with the reload speeds of
          any of the unlocks (according to the Wiki, at least). It’s minor, but there’s no reason for this to be a thing.

          This item is capable of shutting down blast jumping because the Mini-Crits don’t care whose

		  To justify this weapon existing on Pyro, I gave it the ability to combo with the primaries like on Soldier.
