      Hitscan Weapons
    </h2>
    <p>
      Most hitscan weapons have a 1.25 second cooldown after firing before the weapon becomes perfectly accurate again (Shotguns and Miniguns have a 0.25 second cooldown instead). For some reason, the accuracy stays bad for the entire 1.25 seconds and suddenly becomes perfect again, instead of gradually becoming more accurate as you would intuitively expect. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is mostly just relevant to the Revolvers (except the Ambassador, which already has this). The other weapons are getting it for the sake of consistency.
